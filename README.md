# Web-scraping-with-Beautiful-soup-an-example-on-cryptocurrency-data

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.x to run the following code.  You can have multiple Python
versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems. Python needs to be first installed then SciPy, Beautiful Soup or the Jupyter Notebook in whichever order as they require Python to be installed at first.

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

Alongside Python, the SciPy packages are also required. In Ubuntu and Debian, the SciPy ecosystem can be installed by:

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose

The Beautiful Soup package is required for data parsing,and it can be installed for Python 3 by:
    
    sudo apt-get install python3-bs4 
    
Finally, the Jupyter Notebook which can be installed through Python's package manager:

    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install jupyter
    
For other Linux flavors, OS X and Windows, packages are available at:

http://www.python.org/getit/  
https://www.scipy.org/install.html

https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html


## File descriptions

* 'Get_coin_data.ipynb' which is the Jupyter Notebook of the project, where all the explanations and steps are explained throughout the notebook.
* 'Get_coin_data.html' which contains the html source code of the html conversion of the Jupyter Notebook.
* '*.jpg' which contains the different pictures in the notebook.


### Running the files

The code is ready to be used and just requires running the following command:
